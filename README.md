# hello-world
First github repository


Hi,
I am a newbie to the world of Github, Docker and Kubernetes having worked predominantly in more traditional environments where everything was kept and managed in-house.  I have a lot experience in that sphere but none with the on-line environments and this is my first foray into this brave new world.

Cheers
Baz
